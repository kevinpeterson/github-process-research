## The GitHub Open Source Development Process

### Abstract
Open Source Software (OSS) has produced many successful projects. The development process by which these projects are produced is generally unstructured compared to commercial software -- but a definite pattern does arrive, and is no less a pattern. GitHub, a popular OSS code hosting website, and Git, the site's SCM of choice, may have the potential to fundamentally change this process. By analyzing a subset of GitHub repositories, this report will show how GitHub has influenced some very intrinsic aspects of traditional OSS development, such as developer hierarchies and issue close velocity. We find that many of the traditional aspects of OSS development remain, such most project development is done by a small group of core developers. Others assumptions about project hierarchy, such as a large number of Issue Reporters compared to Committers, seems unsupported by the data.
